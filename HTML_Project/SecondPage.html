	<h1>Short Story About Me</h1>
	<p>I was born in Hamilton, MT I spend my entire childhood there and didn't move very far went I left for college. I love it here in Montana and doubt I'll ever leave but that doesn't mean I don't like to travel. I haven't been to a lot of places but recently over the summer my girlfriend and I drove out to Newport, OR which is on the coast. We absolutely loved it there! I'm not much of an artist considering I'm a computer science major. I'm a little bit more of analytical thinker than I am a creative one. But you insited on putting some artwork on this page so I'll include some pictures I took while in Newport this last July. I'll also include of photo of my lovely girlfriend of nearly two years at the Chowder Bowl in Newport, the one I mentioned on my homepage. You can click on all the pictures to get a better look if need be!</p>
